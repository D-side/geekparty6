Slimes!
==========

HTML5 game made in ~7 hours for GeekParty 6, held on 25th of January, 2014.

Theme: fighting games. Conditions of game jam have prevented me from implementing any sort of AI, so this is intended to be played by two players.

The idea is to fit a Mario-like combat system (stomp your opponent) into competitive multiplayer. Damage dealt is proportional to a difference of speeds, the slower one gets hit. This simple system enables players to block, strike and dodge by moving only.

### Controls
Listed in-game: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` for left player and `arrow keys` for the right player. Hold and release for an action to happen. Possible actions:
* Dash, left or right
* Jump, up
* Stomp, down

### Tools used:
* [GameMaker: Studio Professional 1.2](http://yoyogames.com/studio)
* [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org)
* [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net)
